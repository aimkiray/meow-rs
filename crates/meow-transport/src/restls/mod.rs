//! restls — a Shadowsocks SIP003 transport that hides inside a real TLS
//! handshake with a cover host (upstream `restls-client-go`, used by mihomo's
//! `restls` plugin).
//!
//! The client performs a real TLS handshake with the cover: the session_id
//! carries a keyed BLAKE3 tag over the offered key shares so a restls server
//! can authenticate the client without changing anything else on the wire.
//! After the handshake the cover's first encrypted record is masked with a
//! keyed value (`maskServerAuth`); when the mask uncovers a decryptable
//! record the peer is a restls relay and application data travels in tagged
//! `application_data` records shaped by the record script. When the mask
//! does not uncover (the peer is a plain relay) the stream transparently
//! continues as the negotiated cover TLS connection.
//!
//! Because restls commits the auth tag into `session_id` — part of the TLS
//! transcript — a generic TLS stack cannot implement it faithfully; the
//! handshake is driven at the record level here (see `tls13`), reusing the
//! pattern established by `reality_tls`.
//!
//! Known divergences from the upstream Go client (which runs a full uTLS
//! parrot + TLS stack): HelloRetryRequest is rejected rather than
//! processed — all three supported key shares are offered up front so a
//! group-mismatch HRR cannot occur, but a cover that demands a cookie HRR
//! (anti-DDoS) cannot complete; and the ClientHello is a fixed Chrome-like
//! shape rather than a selectable uTLS parrot (`client-id`).
