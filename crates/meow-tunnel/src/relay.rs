// M2 relay-buffer-pool (ADR-0011 T6):
//   `tokio::io::copy_bidirectional_with_sizes` allocates a `Box<[u8]>` per
//   direction per connection (via `CopyBuffer::new`). At 4 KiB per direction
//   that is 8 KiB heap per TCP connection setup — confirmed in the dhat
//   baseline as sites #2 and #3 (66 MB each over 8 105 connections).
//
//   This module provides `copy_bidirectional_buf` which accepts caller-supplied
//   `&mut [u8]` scratch buffers. Callers declare `[0u8; BUF]` arrays inside the
//   enclosing async fn; those arrays become part of the future's state machine
//   and are paid for at task-spawn time (one allocation per task, shared with
//   everything else in the future), not at relay-call time.
//
//   Public API: `copy_bidirectional_buf` and `RELAY_BUF_SIZE`.
//   No new public types exposed — no M2 API break.
//
// Direction fairness (#345):
//   The two directions are driven by ONE future, so they can never run on two
//   cores at once — but they must not starve each other either. Each direction
//   advances at most one buffer fill+drain cycle per turn, and turns strictly
//   alternate a→b, b→a inside the poll loop. A busy direction therefore delays
//   the other by at most one `RELAY_BUF_SIZE` cycle, instead of monopolizing
//   the task until its reader runs dry (the pre-#345 behavior, where a→b was
//   always polled first and drained to `Pending` before b→a ever ran).
//   `RELAY_CYCLES_PER_POLL` additionally bounds total work per poll so the
//   relay yields to sibling tasks even on streams that don't participate in
//   tokio's coop budget.
